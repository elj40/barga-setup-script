# barga-setup-script
Short script that configures settings and installs programs to my preference

## Install
1. Click on code, then download zip (or use whatever git method you like)
2. Unzip the file, to wherever you want e.g. H:/setup

## Running it
Either
- Navigate in terminal to same path as script and run `./barga_setup.ps1`
or
- Double click the file

## Editing it

Change it to however you like, just google "How to do xyz in powershell and just add that command to the script"

Enjoy
